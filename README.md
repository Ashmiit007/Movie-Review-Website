# Movie review site

Built a responsive movie review website using React, it provides and interactive interface for an author to add a review,
view reviews of other authors and also allows them to delete a review.
Implemented time-based indexing in the website, ensuring that the latest reviews appear at the top of the list. By incorpo-
rating this feature, users can quickly access the most recent reviews.
